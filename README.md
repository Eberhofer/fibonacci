# fibonacci

Fun with koa and fibonacci numbers - really just to learn **Node.js** and **koa**.

It uses koa js and tries to make as much mileage with as little dependencies as possible. Instead of promises, async code flow is shaped with generators. Having said that, it's just a recreational project without ambition. Fun with fibonacci and koa.

### koa-static

## koa
